<p>One of the annoying things about creating a new Reddit account is having to unsubscribe from all of the default subreddits. You actually have to click unsubscribe for each of the ~50 default subreddits...until now.</p>

<p>Out of irrational anger, we created EasyUnsub, a simple app that makes unsubscribing a little less infuriating. We say a <em>little less</em> because it still isn't an instantaneous process (it would be if Reddit decided to write a few lines of code!).</p>

<p>To use this app you need to login with your Reddit account, click a button that selects all of your subscribed subreddits, click another button to submit the form, and then click yet another button to confirm that you want to unsubscribe.</p>

<p>Hey, at least you aren't clicking unsubscribe ~50 times like some kind of animal.</p>

<p><strong>Click the button below to login with your Reddit account and get started.</strong></p>
